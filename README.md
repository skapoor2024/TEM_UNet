Our lab developed a neural network model to predict the behavior of grains in polycrystalline structures. However, the model was limited by its reliance on simulated data produced by SPPARKS , a Monte Carlo based model.
To address this limitation, this project focused on creating a image segmentation system that could identify individual grains within images captured using Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) to generate real world data. By incorporating real-world data from TEM images, we hoped to verify the algorithms integrity for the real world dataset.
